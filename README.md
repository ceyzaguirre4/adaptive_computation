# Adaptive Computation Time

PyTorch implementation of ["Adaptive Computation Time for Recurrent Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08983).

Training can be done using `run_train.py` and passing the appropiate configuration file.

~~~python
python3 run_train.py --config-file=configs/rnn_addition.yaml
